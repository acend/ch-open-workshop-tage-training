From the [previous lab](../04_deletingcontainers/):

> Question: Where do these strange names come from?

Answer: Docker (what a surprise!)... Besides the CONTAINER ID the NAME is a unique identifier for a container.


## Naming a container

Unlike the CONTAINER ID the NAME is something we can manipulate. The name is handy not only for starting/connecting/stopping/destroying a container, but also for the networking (which comes later in the lab).

To do so, you have to add a parameter to the `run` command of Docker

```bash
docker run --name mariadb-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mariadb
```

As always, to check if this has really worked out look at the container list

```bash
docker ps
```

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
6f08ac657320        mariadb             "docker-entrypoint..."   58 seconds ago      Up 57 seconds       3306/tcp            mariadb-container
699e82ed8f1f        mariadb             "docker-entrypoint..."   24 minutes ago      Up 24 minutes       3306/tcp            jolly_bardeen
```

If you want to access your DB server there are two ways:

1) Using `docker exec -it mariadb-container bash`
   This will connect you to the remote `bash` shell from where you can connect to the server via `mysql -uroot -pmy-secret-pw`.

1) Using a local mysqlclient
   This is a bit tricky. First you have to find out the IP address of your docker container. Therefore, use this command:

```bash
docker inspect mariadb-container
```

```

                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

In the last section (`NetworkSettings`) you will find the `IPAddress` for your container. In this example it's 172.17.0.2.
Once you have the IP you can connect with the command `mysql -h172.17.0.2 -uroot -p` (use password from run command)

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
The mysql client must be installed on your computer. On Windows, you can use the binary from the ZIP archive at <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/>.

Also on Windows you must use port-forwarding to access the database:

```bash
docker run --name mariadb-container -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mariadb
```

Now you should be able to access the database by: `winpty mysql.exe -hlocalhost -uroot -p`.
