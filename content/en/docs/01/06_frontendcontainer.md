Answer: Now we have a "backend", why not deploy a frontend container (e.g. httpd & php) and make them speak with each other?


## Deploying a frontend container

First thing: Find the fitting Docker image --> Where? Exactly... [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

We recommend the `php:7-apache` image.

```bash
docker pull php:7-apache
```

Once it is pulled let's have a look into `docker images`:

```bash
docker images
```

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
php                 7.0-apache          b8fe22aeffdf        5 days ago          390MB
mariadb             latest              58730544b81b        2 weeks ago         397MB
hello-world         latest              1815c82652c0        2 months ago        1.84kB
hello-world         linux               1815c82652c0        2 months ago        1.84kB

```

Besides the known `mariadb` image, there is one new image. Furthermore, the php REPOSITORY has a different TAG than the other REPOSITORIES.
When you use the `pull` command Docker will always pull down the latest versions of the REPOSITORY but by requesting php:7-apache you have pulled a specific TAG.
So Docker labels it that way.

>
> * An image is a collection of files + some metadata (or in technical terms: those files form the root filesystem of a container)
> * Images are made of layers, conceptually stacked on top of each other
> * Each layer can add, change, and remove files
> * Images can share layers to optimize disk usage, transfer times and memory use

> * docker run starts a container from a given image

Now we can deploy the new container using the correct tag.

```bash
docker run -d --name apache-php php:7-apache
```

With `docker ps` you see that the new container is running.

```bash
docker ps
```

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
b901d6c0473a        php:7-apache        "docker-php-entryp..."   18 seconds ago      Up 17 seconds       80/tcp              apache-php
50197361e87b        mariadb             "docker-entrypoint..."   42 minutes ago      Up 42 minutes       3306/tcp            mariadb-container-with-existing-external-volume
6f08ac657320        mariadb             "docker-entrypoint..."   4 hours ago         Up 2 hours          3306/tcp            mariadb-container

```

Okay so let's try to connect to the server, via the container assigned docker IP address:

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
If you are working on Windows with anything else than Git Bash, `grep` will probably not be available.
In this case, use `findstr` instead.
{{% /alert %}}

```bash
docker inspect apache-php | grep IPAddress
```

```
...
            "SecondaryIPAddresses": null,
            "IPAddress": "172.17.0.4",
                    "IPAddress": "172.17.0.4",
...
```

With the IP from the inspection we can now navigate to the web server at <http://172.17.0.4>.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
As the Docker Linux bridge is not reachable from your Windows or MacOS host you cannot access the container directly via IP address.
See:

* <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/networking/>
* <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/>

If you've already started the `apache-php` container without port forwarding you have to stop and remove it first:

```bash
docker stop apache-php
docker rm apache-php
```

Now start the container again with port forwarding:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 -d --name apache-php php:7-apache
```

Now you can access the web server at <http://LOCALHOST:8080>.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Note for play-with-docker.com" color="primary" %}}
This is not possible without port forwarding, see [next lab](../08/).
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
It might be that your local firewall blocks requests to this address.
{{% /alert %}}

And unfortunately we get a "403 Error - Forbidden".

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Do not forget to remove the existing instance of the `apache-php` container.
{{% /alert %}}

> Question: Why? Why do I get this error? Is there no other way to access the web server via private IP?

Go on and find the answers in the [next lab](../07_embeddingsource/).
