This lab helps you troubleshoot your application and shows you some tools to make troubleshooting easier.


## Logging into a container

Running containers should be treated as immutable infrastructure and should therefore not be modified. However, there are some use cases in which you have to log into your running container. Debugging and analyzing is one example for this.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Shell into Pod

With {{% param distroName %}} you can open a remote shell into a Pod without installing SSH by using the command `{{% onlyWhenNot openshift %}}kubectl exec{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}{{% onlyWhen openshift %}}oc rsh{{% /onlyWhen %}}`. The command can also be used to execute any command in a Pod.
{{% onlyWhenNot openshift %}}With the parameter `-it` you can leave an open connection.{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
On Windows, you can use Git Bash and `winpty`.
{{% /alert %}}

Choose a Pod with `{{% param cliToolName %}} get pods --namespace <namespace>` and execute the following command:
{{% onlyWhenNot openshift %}}
```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod> --namespace <namespace> -- /bin/bash
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen openshift %}}
```bash
oc rsh --namespace <namespace> <pod>
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}
{{% onlyWhenNot openshift %}}
{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
If Bash is not available in the Pod you can fallback to `-- sh` instead of `-- /bin/bash`.
{{% /alert %}}
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

You now have a running shell session inside the container in which you can execute every binary available, e.g.:

```bash
ls -l
```

```
total 12
-rw-r--r--    1 10020700 root          8192 Nov 27 15:12 hellos.db
-rwxrwsr-x    1 web      root          2454 Oct  5 08:55 run.py
drwxrwsr-x    1 web      root            17 Oct  5 08:55 static
drwxrwsr-x    1 web      root            63 Oct  5 08:55 templates
```

With `exit` or `CTRL+d` you can leave the container and close the connection:

```bash
exit
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Single commands

{{% onlyWhenNot openshift %}}
Single commands inside a container can also be executed with `kubectl exec`:

```bash
kubectl exec <pod> --namespace <namespace> -- env
```

Example:

```bash
$ kubectl exec example-web-python-69b658f647-xnm94 --namespace <namespace> -- env
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
HOSTNAME=example-web-python-xnm94
KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_DNS_TCP=53
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_PROTO=tcp
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR=172.30.0.1
KUBERNETES_PORT_53_UDP_PROTO=udp
KUBERNETES_PORT_53_TCP=tcp://172.30.0.1:53
...
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}
{{% onlyWhen openshift %}}
Single commands inside a container can also be executed with `oc rsh`:

```bash
oc rsh --namespace <namespace> <pod> <command>
```

Example:

```
oc rsh --namespace acend-test example-web-python-8b465c687-t9g7b env
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
TERM=xterm
HOSTNAME=example-web-python-8b465c687-t9g7b
NSS_SDB_USE_CACHE=no
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP=tcp://172.30.0.1:443
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_PORT=443
EXAMPLE_WEB_PYTHON_PORT_5000_TCP_PORT=5000
...
```


## The debug command

One of the disadvantages of using the `oc rsh` command is that it depends on the container to actually run. If the Pod can't even start, this is a problem but also where the `oc debug` command comes in.
The `oc debug` command starts an interactive shell using the definition of a Deployment, Pod, DaemonSet, Job or even an ImageStreamTag. In OpenShift 4 it can also be used to open a shell on a Node to analyze it.

The quick way of using it is `oc debug RESOURCE/NAME` but have a good look at its help page. There are some very interesting parameters like `--as-root` that give you (depending on your permissions on the cluster) a very powerful means of debugging a Pod.
{{% /onlyWhen %}}


## Watching log files

Log files of a Pod can be shown with the following command:


```bash
{{% param cliToolName %}} logs <pod> --namespace <namespace>
```

The parameter `-f` allows you to follow the log file (same as `tail -f`). With this, log files are streamed and new entries are shown immediately.

When a Pod is in state `CrashLoopBackOff` it means that although multiple attempts have been made, no container inside the Pod could be started successfully. Now even though no container might be running at the moment the `{{% param cliToolName %}} logs` command is executed, there is a way to view the logs the application might have generated. This is achieved using the `-p` or `--previous` parameter:

 ```bash
{{% param cliToolName %}} logs -p <pod> --namespace <namespace>
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3: Port forwarding

{{% param distroName %}} allows you to forward arbitrary ports to your development workstation. This allows you to access admin consoles, databases, etc., even when they are not exposed externally. Port forwarding is handled by the {{% param distroName %}} master and therefore tunneled from the client via HTTPS. This allows you to access the {{% param distroName %}} platform even when there are restrictive firewalls or proxies between your workstation and {{% param distroName %}}.

Get the name of the Pod:

```bash
{{% param cliToolName %}} get pod --namespace <namespace>
```

Then execute the port forwarding command using the Pod's name:

```bash
{{% param cliToolName %}} port-forward <pod> 5000:5000 --namespace <namespace>
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Use the additional parameter `--address <IP address>` (where `<IP address>` refers to a NIC's IP address from your local workstation) if you want to access the forwarded port from outside your own local workstation.
{{% /alert %}}

The output of the command should look like this:

```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:5000 -> 5000
Forwarding from [::1]:5000 -> 5000
```

Don't forget to change the Pod name to your own installation. If configured, you can use auto-completion.

The application is now available with the following link: <http://localhost:5000/>. Or try a `curl` command:

```bash
curl localhost:5000
```

With the same concept you can access databases from your local workstation or connect your local development environment via remote debugging to your application in the Pod.

{{% onlyWhenNot openshift %}}[This documentation page](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/port-forward-access-application-cluster){{% /onlyWhenNot %}}{{% onlyWhen openshift %}}[This documentation page](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/nodes/containers/nodes-containers-port-forwarding.html){{% /onlyWhen %}} offers some more details about port forwarding.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
The `{{% param cliToolName %}} port-forward` process runs as long as it is not terminated by the user. So when done, stop it with `CTRL-c`.
{{% /alert %}}


## Progress

At this point, you are able to visualize your progress on the labs by browsing through the following page <http://localhost:5000/progress>

You may need to set some extra permissions to let the dashboard monitor your progress. Have fun!

```bash
{{% param cliToolName %}} create rolebinding progress --clusterrole=view --serviceaccount=<namespace>:default --namespace=<namespace>
```


## Events

{{% param distroName %}} maintains an event log with high-level information on what's going on in the cluster.
It's possible that everything looks okay at first but somehow something seems stuck.
Make sure to have a look at the events because they can give you more information if something is not working as expected.

Use the following command to list the events in chronological order:

```bash
{{% param cliToolName %}} get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp --namespace <namespace>
```
