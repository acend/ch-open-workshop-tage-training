In this lab, we are going to have a look at the different Deployment strategies.

For more details, have a look at the [examples](https://github.com/ContainerSolutions/k8s-deployment-strategies) or use [this demo](https://github.com/acend/deployment-strategies-demo) in which the different strategies are implemented as Helm charts.
